# Catch-The-Falling-Objects-Sixth-Sense-Version

# Welcome to the Sixth sense verion of Catch the objects

# Instead of keyboards, use hand gestures to control your player

# Each red box represents the respective position of your player. 

# By default the game is made to detect yellow color(like the backside of Fevistick). You can change the color by changing teh variables- lower_value and upper_value

# Note- Make sure that the color you are using is not presnet in your background. To help you understand which color the camera is detecting, I have added a red dot at the center of the object that the camera is deteting

# Warning- The game will not start untill you put the yellow(default) color in front of the camera

# Enjoy!
